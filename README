Assignment 2: Game Playing

This document covers my Konane game playing agents.

Submission Contents
src/Makefile: 
	a makefile for the java code.
src/edu/jhu/iwilkes1/cs335/hw2/Konane.java 
	The file which contains the main function to run konane.

src/edu/jhu/iwilkes1/cs335/hw2/board 
	directory containing helper files provided
	by Ben Mitchell.  The only file which has been edited is board.java, 
	which has had a copy constructor added, as well as a board evaluation 
	function.

src/edu/jhu/iwilkes1/cs335/hw2/players/AlphaBetaNode.java 
	Is a class used to recursively populate the alpha and beta values of
	the konane search tree, depending on the maximum search depth.
				

src/edu/jhu/iwilkes1/cs335/hw2/players/MinimaxPlayer.java
	An agent to play konane using the standard implementation of minimax.

src/edu/jhu/iwilkes1/cs335/hw2/players/AlphaBetaPlayer.java
	An agent designed to use the alpha beta node to play konane.

src/edu/jhu/iwilkes1/cs335/hw2/players/Player.java
	Standard interface to which all konane players conform.

src/edu/jhu/iwilkes1/cs335/hw2/players/HumanPlayer.java
	Implementation of a human player of konane.

doc/ 
	directory for the javadocs, which can be created by make doc from the 
	src folder. Also contains the writeup as assignment2_writeup.pdf

bin/
	directory for all binaries created by compilation

output/ 
	directory containting a few example runs of the konane game.


Usage

In order to compile the java files required, run compile.sh.
To run the files, run run.sh

Upon startup, the code prompts the user for the size of the board.
Allowable sizes are 4, 6, and 8.  Next, the user is prompted to decide which
types of players they would like to use. The options are human, minimax, and 
alpha beta pruning.  If the user selects either minimax or alpha beta, they
will be prompted to provide a maximum search depth for that player.  

I recommend depths of 10 for a 4x4 board, 8 for a 6x6 board, and 6 for an 8x8 
board in order to get quick responses from the ai.
